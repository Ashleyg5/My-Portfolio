          Hi there! I'm Ashley, a 23 year old passionate and dedicated full stack web developer based in Orlando, Florida.
          <br />
          <br />
          I graduated from the University of Central Florida with a Bachelor's degree in Public Relations. While my educational background provided me with a strong foundation in communication and problem-solving skills, I discovered my true passion for technology during my time at UCF's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. I successfully completed the program and received a certificate, equipping me with the latest tools and techniques in web development.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a multilingual professional, I bring a unique perspective to my work. Fluent in Spanish, English, and Portuguese, I am able to bridge the gap between diverse audiences and create seamless user experiences.
          <br />
          <br />
          One of my defining traits is my exceptional attention to detail. I thrive on ensuring every line of code is meticulously crafted and every pixel is perfectly placed. With a keen eye for design and usability, I strive to create visually appealing and intuitive web applications.

          In addition to being detail-oriented, I am proficient at multitasking and have excellent time management skills. I thrive in fast-paced environments and have a proven ability to meet deadlines without compromising quality. I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skill set and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the web development industry.
          <br />
          <br />
          Currently, I am actively seeking my first job as a full stack web developer. I am excited to contribute my skills and collaborate with a dynamic team to create innovative and impactful web solutions.
          <br />
          <br />
          Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look forward to connecting with you and discussing how I can contribute to your organization's success.
